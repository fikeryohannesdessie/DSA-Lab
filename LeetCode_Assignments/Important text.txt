I admit im not the most skilled in these area
I'm trying to better myself by practicing and looking for sources that would help me code.
Hopefully I wont have to rely on these sources and code by myself in the near future.
This sources are mostly youtube lecture videoes, useful websites like geeksforgeeks, leetcode and others as well
This assignment was difficult to do alone so I have relied in all of those above to help me out I even reached out to a friend of mine(3rd year SE student)for help

Thankyou for your attention in this matter
